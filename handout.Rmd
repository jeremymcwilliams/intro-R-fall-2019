# Intro to R & Data Visualization workshop

### Watzek Library Digital Initiatives
### October 30th, 2019

###### Much of the content has been borrowed from Harvard University, so thank you Harvard.

### Goals of this workshop:

* Gain some familiarity with RStudio Server
* Write some basic R code
* Work with a data set
* Create some basic plots


### Basic R code

R code can be run in the console, or as a "code chunk" within this R notebook. Below is a code chunk:

```{r}
2+2
```

You can run the code chunk by clicking the green "play" button. Throughout this workshop, there will be a mix of code chunks pre-populated with code, and empty code chunks. The empty code chunks give you an opportunity to write code, run it, and see the output. Each of the empty chunks are preceded with "YOUR TURN:".

#### Assigning variables

Creating variables in R isn't so bad. Most scripting languages use the "=" sign, but R uses "<-". So below, I'm creating a variable x, and setting it equal to 10. Afterward, I entered "x", which should output the value of x:

```{r}
x<-10

x
```


YOUR TURN:
Now try creating a variable "y", set it equal to 7+9, and then print it out:
```{r}


```

Like most languages, R has functions that help you quickly execute common tasks. Functions typically take the form of:

functionName(argument1, argument2, etc....)

For example, the function sqrt(number) takes the square root of a number:

```{r}
sqrt(9)
```

YOUR TURN:
In the chunk below, create a variable 'z', set it equal to the sqare root of 90, and print it out:
```{r}


```





This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
