# Intro to R & Data Visualization workshop

### Watzek Library Digital Initiatives
### October 30th, 2019

Welcome to the workshop! Much of the content has been borrowed from Harvard University, so thank you Harvard.

### Goals of this workshop:

* Gain some familiarity with RStudio Server
* Write some basic R code
* Work with a data set
* Create some basic plots


### Basic R code

R code can be run in the console, or as a "code chunk" within this R notebook. Below is a code chunk:

```{r}
2+2
```

You can run the code chunk by clicking the green "play" button. Throughout this workshop, there will be a mix of code chunks pre-populated with code, and empty code chunks. The empty code chunks give you an opportunity to write code, run it, and see the output.














This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
